## About GoForj

GoForj is a modern Go ecosystem for building real-world applications with clarity, performance, and joy.

We believe Go development should be **productive without being verbose**, **powerful without being complex**, and **opinionated without being restrictive**. GoForj takes the sharp edges off application development by providing a cohesive set of tools, libraries, and conventions inspired by the best parts of frameworks like Laravel—while remaining idiomatic, explicit, and fast.

GoForj focuses on the things developers actually build: services, CLIs, APIs, workers, schedulers, and tooling that scales from side projects to production systems.

### GoForj helps you with:

- Expressive, fluent APIs that feel natural in Go.
- Strong defaults with explicit escape hatches.
- Zero-magic design — no hidden globals, no runtime surprises.
- Performance-first implementations with benchmarks and tests.
- Excellent developer experience, from scaffolding to deployment.

## The GoForj Ecosystem

GoForj is not a single framework — it’s a **forged toolkit** designed to work together or stand alone.

Some of the core packages include:

- **`collection`** — A fluent, generics-powered collection library with predictable performance.
- **`env`** — Environment variable management with `.env` ergonomics and production safety.
- **`crypt`** — Secure, application-level encryption inspired by Laravel’s Crypt facade.
- **`godump`** — A beautiful, Laravel-style dumper for inspecting data during development.
- **`forj`** — A CLI scaffolding and orchestration tool for generating full Go applications.

Each package is independently versioned, fully tested, documented, and usable on its own — but together they form a cohesive development experience.

## Philosophy

GoForj is built around a few core principles:

- **Explicit over implicit**  
  Configuration is visible. Behavior is predictable. You always know what your code is doing.

- **Boring, proven primitives**  
  We build on the Go standard library and battle-tested patterns.

- **Developer experience matters**  
  Clean APIs, helpful errors, readable docs, and real examples are not optional.

- **Performance is a feature**  
  Benchmarks are included. Allocations matter. Trade-offs are documented.

- **Production-first**  
  Everything is designed with real deployment environments in mind.

## Getting Started

Each GoForj package includes:

- Clear installation instructions
- Practical examples
- API documentation
- Benchmarks and test coverage

You can start small by adopting a single package, or go all-in with the full GoForj toolchain.

👉 Explore the repositories below to get started.

## Learning GoForj

GoForj is designed to be approachable if you already know Go.

Documentation lives directly alongside the code, with:

- README-driven onboarding
- Example-first explanations
- Real-world usage patterns
- Copy-paste-ready snippets

As the ecosystem grows, additional guides, tutorials, and reference applications will be published to demonstrate full-stack GoForj applications in practice.

## Community & Contribution

GoForj is open-source and community-driven.

Contributions are welcome in the form of:

- Bug reports
- Performance improvements
- Documentation enhancements
- New ideas and discussions

If you care about building great tools for Go developers, you’re in the right place.
